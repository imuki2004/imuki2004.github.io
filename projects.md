# Projects

## Deep Learning

- **Semi-Supervised Deep Learning for Multi-Class Image Classification**  
  - Developed a semi-supervised deep learning pipeline using PyTorch to classify 14 flower categories.  
  - Designed a custom DeepResNet architecture (20M parameters) with residual blocks, MixUp regularization, and pseudo-labeling.  
  - Implemented advanced training techniques, including a custom scheduler, boosting generalization on a high-performance V100 GPU cluster.

## GenAI/LLMs

- **Chat with your PDF**  
  - Designed a Streamlit-based application allowing users to upload PDFs and engage in natural language conversations.  
  - Integrated Qdrant for vector similarity search and a locally hosted Ollama model (deepseek-r1:8b) for context-aware answers.
